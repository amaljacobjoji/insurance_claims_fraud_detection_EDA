Insurance Claims Fraud Detection with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project explores insurance claim data with the aim of identifying potential fraudulent claims using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pandas. The data contains information on customers, policies, incidents, and claims and other features


The EDA process will involve:

* Understanding the data: Checking data types, identifying missing values, and summarizing basic statistics.
* Analyzing distributions: Visualizing the distribution of key features for both fraudulent and legitimate claims.
* Exploring relationships: Investigating potential correlations between features and the target variable using visualizations and statisticalÂ tests.
